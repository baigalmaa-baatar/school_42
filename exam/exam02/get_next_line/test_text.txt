Delhi is a crowded city.
There are very few rich people who travel by their own vehicles.
The majority of the people cannot afford to hire a taxi or a three-wheelerThey have to depend on D.T.Cbuses, 
which are the cheapest mode of conveyanceD.T.Cbuses are like blood capillaries of our body spreading 
all over in DelhiOne day I had to go to railway station to receive my uncleI had to reach 
there by 9.30 a.mknowing the irregularity of D.T.Cbus service; I left my home at 
7.30 a.mand reached the bus stopThere was a long queueEverybody was waiting for 
the bus but the buses were passing one after another without stoppingI kept waiting
 for about an hourI was feeling very restless and I was afraid that I might not be able
to reach the station in timeIt was 8.45Luckily a bus stopped just in front of meIt 
was overcrowded but somehow I managed to get into the busSome passengers were hanging
on the footboard, so there was no question of getting a seatIt was very uncomfortableWe 
were feeling suffocatedAll of a sudden, an old man declared that his pocket had been
pickedHe accused the man standing beside himThe young man took a knife out of his
pocket and waved it in the airNo body dared to catch himI thanked God when the bus
stopped at the railway stationI reached there just in time.

2Look Before You Leap

the earlier years of her freedomIt took years to recover from the heavy
losses of the warThen large-scale industries, like Iron and Steel showed
